# Rubyistokei

Introduce your ruby heroes with the clock!

## What is this?

Rubyistokei is a web application to show a clock of rubyists, by rubyists, for rubyists. You can introduce your ruby heros to the world with the clock. "Tokei" (時計) means "clock" in Japanese.

Rubyistokei shows rubyists every minute. We want to help rubyists to know rubyists each other by sight. Rubyistokei will be displayed during RubyKaigi 2013 in the venue.

So, we kindly ask you to add your ruby heroes to this project. Instruction follows.

## How to add a ruby hero?

1. Obtain permissions from both of the rubyist and the photographer (if you are not of them).
2. Create metadata for the rubyist under (data directory)[https://github.com/darashi/rubyistokei/tree/master/data].
3. Send pull request.

## Hits

* The image is once scaled to 1024x768, then rescaled to fit with the screen size. Geometries should be specified in pixels, suit for the case when the image is shown on 1024x768.
* Short introduction should be one of the most important part. (NOTE: not implemented yet)
